- Basic movement: hjkl
- h - up level/close; j - next; k - previous; l - down level/open
- e - expand (more)
- Q - exit
- Current status
	- ~~Expect it blow up any time~~
	- **Stable, seems to be used not only by me**
		- Slow feature creep unless someone wants to help
- Where you can help (future direction)
	- In loose order of complexity/time-investment:
	- Code and comments clean up. Some comments are probably wrong.
		- The lesson is that comments should evolve along the function. Doing it afterwards feels like a burden and hence the output product is of not-best quality.
	- More readline-like bindings in edit mode
		- Things like delete word/line, undo/redo, kill/yank/paste.
	- Wide-char input handling
		- E.g. Japanese. There is a difference between Unicode, UTF-8, wide- and narrow-characters, bytes/chars and multi-byte characters. And yes, this can be confusing.
	- Word-wrapping
	- Building on other platforms
		- This should build cleanly on Linux, FreeBSD and OS X. Other distro/OS/platform confirmations and/or issues are welcome.
	- Help is appreciated in form of PRs on GitHub or patches directly via e-mail.
- Browsing mode keys
	- h, j, k, l - level-aware movement
	- h, j - scrolling current entry when in partial view mode
	- n, m - visual movement
	- g, G - go to top, bottom of the document
	- JK - move current entry down/up
	- HL - de/indent current entry
	- In other words hjkl is normal movement, HJKL is 'dragging' movement
	- e, c - expand (more/all), collapse all
	- d - toggle entry done (cross-out)
	- D - delete current entry
	- f - toggle entry highlight (bold)
	- U - try to restore the last deleted element (aka undo)
		- This tries to put the restored element where it was before deletion. In theory the restored element should appear near wherever the next, previous or parent element of the deleted entry currently is. But please be careful with realying on this too much.
	- File operations
		- r - reload current file
		- s - save current file
		- o - open another file
		- S - save current list as
	- Additional functions
		- F1 - show absolute path to current file
		- F2 - show version and legal information
	- <enter> - edit current entry, switches to edit mode
	- i - insert new entry, switches to edit mode
- Editing mode keys
	- <home>, <end> - move the cursor to beginning, end
	- <cursor keys> - line-aware movement
	- <enter> - finish editing
	- Experimental readline-like bindings
		- C-b (Ctrl-B) - move back one character
		- C-f (Ctrl-F) - move forward one character
		- Anything more involved (e.g. move by words, delete world/line, undo/redo, kill/yank/paste) is beyond scope _I'd_ like to work on, but I'd welcome PRs and/or patches that implement such functionality.
- Command line
	- Just run it with '-h' to get the list
	- Locale can be overriden, so you may use a decent UTF-8 one
	- Fixed-column mode can be both configured and overriden
		- Uses column mode by default
	- Background color 'approach' can now be both configured and overriden
		- Uses terminal background by default
- Configuration
	- Most stuff can be configured by editing user.h
		- You can adjust bullet glyphs there
		- And also translate most of the UI
		- Defaults for bg color, column mode an highlight attributes
		- The main key bindings are now also configurable, but note that you're limited only to 'normal characters' i.e. no escape sequences/'special' keys (e.g. you can't bind up arrow, Ctrl-<letter> etc.)
	- You can modify colors in colors.c
	- ~~Changing key bindings is somewhat more involved, but feel free to extract the currently hard-coded ones into a separate header file (e.g. keys.h)~~
- File format information
	- Markdown compatible (uses '~~' for crossed-out items, so technically the format is GFM - GitHub Flavoured Markdown)
	- Highlighted entries are saved as bold text ('**'). The order is always crossed, then bold. (e.g. crossed-out bold 'item' -> '~~**item**~~')
	- It is very important to use tabs for indentation
	- The file should be encoded according to the current locale
- Bugs/Features
	- You'll need to write file paths by hand, like on the C64
	- When opening a file the file access error also includes non-existent file, so first check if the path is ok
	- Resizing will work only when in browsing mode, and may still be rather wonky
	- While you should be able to browse wide-character lists (e.g. Japanese), editing won't work, probably
	- No word-wrapping
	- No spell-checking
	- Expand function works funny. It's 'expand more' with a fresh file, and then turns into 'expand all'
	- Definitely bugs:
		- ~~Segfault on empty file~~
- Unicode test... (bonus)
	- Jak się masz? Świetnie!
	- Как дела? Отлично!
	- ¿Cómo estás? ¡Genial!
	- Comment ça va? Super!
